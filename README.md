From creators of  “CA” and “GA”! (I mean me)

New masterpiece (not) - E&W A!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rule’s are easy. You enter difficulty (an integer). App will start to generate windows error’s and warning’s messages. You need to close them. And as fast, as you can. Their count will be equal to difficulty.

Caution! There is a trap! Button “help”!!! Every other bottom closes message, but not “help”. I was thinking about removing it, but then thought, that without it - to easy.

If you would be wise, maybe you can beat me :sunglasses::
